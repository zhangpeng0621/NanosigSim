Simulation of Nanopore Sequencing Signals Based on BiGRU

# Overview
Oxford Nanopore sequencing is an important sequencing technology, which reads the nucleotide sequence by detecting the electrical current signal changes when DNA molecule is forced to pass through a biological nanopore. The research on signal simulation of nanopore sequencing is highly desirable for method developments of nanopore sequencing applications. To improve the simulation accuracy, we propose a novel signal simulation method based on Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU). We named the proposed method NanosigSim.
